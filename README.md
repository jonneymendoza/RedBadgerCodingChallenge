# RedBadgerCodingChallenge

A simple program that creates a robot and sends instructions to move in Mars and outputs its final position in mars.

There is no unit tests but if i was to create some, i would create it to unit test the UseCase class i created that has all the logic.

I would test a few happy path scenarios, and some paths that would throw a LOST output.

In the code i would futher enchance it by doing some input validations to check that the inpur provided is valid and also add unit tests for these as well.

I would check things like making sure the instructions dont exceed over 50 characters and i would also auto CAPS the instructions letters so a user could input lower case in there as well.

Another validation would be to check that the coodinate value never exceeds over 50.

I would also ammend the usecase to take a list of robots and there instructions instead of how it is set out now individually.
